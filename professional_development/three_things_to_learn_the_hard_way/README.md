# Three Things to Learn the Hard Way

### 7-10 minute lightning talk

### Abstract:
There are tons of streamlined resources that make our lives as devs easier, but sometimes hinder long term understanding and growth. I'm here to explain why junior developers should spend their first job using command line git, avoiding ORMs, and making as many mistakes as possible.

This talk was originally written for [Dev Together](https://devtogether.co/) [Chicago's](https://www.meetup.com/DevTogetherChi/) January 2019 meeting with talks themed around ["Your first dev job"](https://www.meetup.com/DevTogetherChi/events/257265309/).
This talk is specifically designed for students and recent graduates seeking their first job. It is not appropriate for a mixed or advanced audience.
