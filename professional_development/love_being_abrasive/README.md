# Nasty Woman or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Being Abrasive

### This talk is available as a 7 minute lightning talk or a 20 minute conferece talk

### Abstract: 

Finding your voice and learning to be loud can be difficult in a male dominated industry that seems to have endless double standards for men and women.

This talk explores how different people interpret the word "abrasive," why dismissing other people's problems as "drama" is unhelpful, and how to learn to find your voice in a world that expects you to be silent.
