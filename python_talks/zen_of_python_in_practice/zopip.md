# **The Zen of Python in Practice**

## Balancing Idealism With Production Concerns

^ My name is Jess Unrein and I'll be talking to you today about the difference between thinkig you've internalized best practices and standards, and then having to live out in the wild with long running code.

^ Intended audience - anyone who has ever worked in Python or wants to work in Python. This talk will hopefully be accessible to beginners but resonate with people who have worked with Python in production before.

^ I'm a software engineer at Sprout Social, and a lot of the code we run is built on foundations that were laid five or six years ago. To me, this is a legacy codebase. The code is older than my career. There are, I'm sure, people here who hardly consider a five year old codebase to be legacy code, and others who are working at start ups who hope to make it to the point where you're complaining about five year old kludge.

# The Beautiful Dream

^ I remember when I first started learning to code. My first language was acutally Ruby, not Python. I found all sorts of resources that constantly reassured me of the beauty and simplicity of Ruby, about how it was written for developer comfort, creativity, and expression.

^ When I went to Dev Bootcamp in January of 2014, we learned more of the same. Their motto was "Make Beautiful and Meaningful Things" and we studied up on refactoring and nitpicking our own greenfield projects, and each project languished unused after the deadline was up.

^ I wrote my first line of Python on the first day of my job right out of Dev Bootcamp. I studied up a bit, and the main resources my coworkers gave me to learn about The Pythonic Way was to check out `import this`. I had no idea what they were getting at.
