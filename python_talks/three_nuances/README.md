# Three Python Nuances I Wish I'd Known Earlier

### 10-15 minutes

### Abstract:
I'll briefly go over three Python gotchas that have given me headaches in the past that I wish I had known about earlier. We'll talk about a good use case for deepcopy, why default mutable arguments are unexpectedly tricky, and the difference "is" and "==" comparators.

This talk was originally written for the [Chicago Python User Group](http://chipy.org) (ChiPy) [January 2019 Meeting](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/events/257467417/). 
This talk is designed for people who are newer to Python, but is appropriate for Pythonistas of any level.
