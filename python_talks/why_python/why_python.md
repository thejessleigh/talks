# [fit] Why Python?

^ 
Intended audience: people looking to get on the "Road to Code." Learn more about the origin of this talk at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/the-road-to-code/chicago/24393).
Why should you consider Python for your first programming langauge?

---

## Quick intro

- Unrelated college degree
- Bootcamp grad
- 2 years in Python
- Chicago PyLadies Co-organizer
- 3-legged cat owner

^ Why should you listen to me about learning Python as your 
first language? 
I come from a non-traditional education background. Although my first language was Ruby, my first job was Python. 
I also coorganize Chicago PyLadies.
PyLadies holds several classes a year designed to teach women to code, ranging from absolute beginner to advanced data science classes led by our resident expert. 
We've also held workshops geared toward getting women into conference sepaking and Open Source.

# [fit] What is :snake: ?

---

# Common uses
- Data science and academia
- Web development
- Scripting

^ Python has great community support in academia and data science. The standard library is a huge contributing factor to this. Examples: requestes and scikitlearn

^ Python is object oriented, making it a powerful and easy to learn web development tool

^ Python is great for quickly automating tasks by writing scripts

## The Zen of Python

```python
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
```

^ No intro to Python talk is complete without a reference to the Zen of Python. The philosophy that distinguishes Python is cheekily laid out here. I've selected a couple passages from the ZoP that highlight why Python is awesome!

^ These first four lines are amazing because they encapsulate the spirit of writing good code. You want to create something beautiful to read that is done in the most efficient way possible.

---

# [fit] `Sparse is better than dense`

^ Significant white space is a defining feature of the language

^ Allows for lines that aren't cluttered up with end statements or semicolons

^ Good formatting practices are structurally enforced in the language

^ Allows you to follow the visual line of a method to detect code smells

---

### `There should be one`
<br>
### `--and preferably only one--`
<br>
### `obvious way to do it.`

^ Other languages provide a lot of syntactic sugar that allows for multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing

^ Python, both the language and the community, believe that good code with obvious, clear implementation is more of a joy to write, and certainly easier to maintain when you're handed code from someone else

^ Because Python has defined standards and explicit stack traces, it's easier to debug than some other languages

---

# [fit] `Errors should never pass silently.`

^ This goes hand in hand with `explicit is better than implicit`. When something goes wrong, you should know immediately.

^ This isn't just a philosophy for writing code however. Like I've mentioned before, Python has a vibrant, active community. When you're struggling for help, you don't have to suffer in silence. It's super easy to ask for help.

# Popular frameworks

- Django
- Flask
- Falcon
- Pyramid

^ Web frameworks are a set of tools that help you craft web applications. They range from heavy hitters like Django to extremely minimal frameworks like Falcon and Flask that provide you with the minimum necessary tools to get your application up and running.

---

## Getting a job in Python

^ Plenty of opportunity in web development.

^ Great if you have a background in statistics - data science opportunities are growing all the time

---

## Python drawbacks

- Large community -> slow to adopt innovation
- The Global Interperter Lock (GIL)
- Fewer bootcamps


^ Python 3 has been out for a long time but still isn't fully adopted by the community

^ You can only have exactly one thread running, even on a mulit-core processor

^ If you're looking to learn coding through a bootcamp, it can be harder to find a good Python intensive camp. College is long and expensive, so this definitely might be a reason to pick Ruby while you're still getting your sea legs.

---

# [fit] `Now is better than never.`

^ The best way to learn how to code is simply by doing it. Start by doing the first few lessons on Codecademy to get a feel for Python.

^ Jump off of codecademy as soon as possible and try to build something small, like a command line flashcard game or a to-do list manager. The sooner you start building something on your own, the sooner you'll figure out if Python is clicking for you as a first language.

^ Never be afraid to ask for help. Stack Overflow, blogs, local Slack commuinites are all great resources for beginning developers
